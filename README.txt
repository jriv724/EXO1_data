In this repo is the analysis of AMO1 cell lines with the following modifications:
A1 : AMO1 control
A2 : AMO1 EXO1_OE
A3 : AMO1 CAD1_KD
A4 : AMO1 EXO1_OE & CAD1 KD

The two main questions addressed in the notebook are:

1.) What genes and pathways predominantly upregulated in A2 but downregulated in A3, relative to A1. Could you make pathway figure and provide excel sheet with list of genes.
n = 25 genes

2.) What genes and pathways predominantly downregulated in A2 but upregulated in A3, relative to A1. Could you make pathway figure and provide excel sheet with list of genes.
n = 301 genes


There was suspected contamination observed in the original clustering, however I subsetted the data on some cells that I suspect are the cells of interest.
